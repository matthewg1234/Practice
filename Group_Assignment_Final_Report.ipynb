        "We picked this project because we wanted to create a company where we could adapt to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, and help people with their shopping orders. This would allow for people to be safe in their own homes if they are high risk for the virus. We started this project by having some inspiration from delivery companies like Uber Eats and DoorDash, and making it applicable to the present pandemic situation. We got to our final ER diagram by identifying the key groups of data that we will need to record, each of their components, and how they would all be connected within the database.\n"

        "For our ER Diagram, we had seven tables to hold all of the information about everything that is needed for our company.  The main table that the rest revolved around is the Trip table.  This table has the primary key of TripID.  The table is then connected to the tables: Payment, Customer, Items, and Driver with their primary keys: TransactionID, CustomerID, ItemID, and LicenseID respectively.  The customer table is connected to the address table due to the address being multivalued and its primary key is StreetAddress. A similar situation happened in the Driver table with Car and it has its own table with PlateID being the primary key.\n"

In addition, our diagram does not contain any transitive dependencies.

The database was called petshop and the “.d” made it a database using the sqlite function.  We made the tables by first doing a check to see if the tables already exist and to delete them if they do.  Then, we made the table using the create table statement and put in the values that were needed to match the ER Diagram.  For inserting data into the table, we used “insert into” and then the table.  In the same statement, we put the values that corresponded with how we made the tables so the values and types matched.\n"
